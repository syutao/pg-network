As actors participate in the production of public goods, processes of social comparison may affect the decisions about the individual contributions as well as the endogenously changing structure of an underlying social network. This leads to a transformation of the common n-player Prisonerâ€™s Dilemma of collective action into an n-player coordination game with multiple equilibria. The agent-based simulations from this project help to select among these equilibria while the initial network structure, which is the density, the segregation, and the strength of relationships, are altered. The simulations contain both a forward- and a backward-looking agent model.
